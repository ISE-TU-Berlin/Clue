=== CLUE: Cloud-native Sustainability Evaluator ===

Clue is a  a benchmarking and observability framework to gather and compile the sustainability and quality reports for changes in your cloud-native applications. 

It can be used as part of your CI/CD pipeline to evaluate the impact of changes or as a standalone tool to evaluate prototypes you are working on.

The framework is designed to be extensible and can be easily integrated with exsiting cloud providers. We curreny rely on Prometheus as to collect all relevant metrics, but we are working on adding support for other monitoring tools. 
Moreover, we are currently focusing on Kubernetes as the orchestrator, so as long as your application is running on Kubernetes, you can use Clue to evaluate it. However, we are working on adding support for other environments as well.
